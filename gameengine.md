    <h2>Ionix Game Engine</h2>
    <p> <strong>Where to use:</strong> <br> Due to Ionix Engine being in development, you currently cannot use it! </p> 
    <p> <strong>Find the source:</strong> <br> Due to being a University Project containing the full cohort, I don't believe the source code will ever be available </p>
    <p><strong>About the Engine:</strong><br>Ionix Engine is a lightweight C++ game engine, with a lua wrapper for simple 2D game development!</p>
    <h3>My Experience:</h3>
      <p>
      <br><strong>Why?</strong> 
      <br>Ionix Engine is being created as apart of the "Games Enignes" unit at university. Ionix Engine is being developed by the full Computer Games Development BSc cohort, who have been split into teams to tackle the various sections of the game engine (Physics, Scripting, Architecture, Input, UI, Graphics/Audio)
      <br><strong>What team was I on?</strong>
      <br> I started the project on the Architecture team, we created layers for the engine for the different teams to interact with by firing events as the engine has been made using the <strong> Observer Patter </strong>. In addition to the layers, I worked on creating the Scene, game object, and components.
