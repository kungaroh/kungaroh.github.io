    <p> <strong>Where to play:</strong></p> <a href="https://kungaroh.itch.io/fire-team" target="_blank">Fire Team</a>
    <p><strong>About the Game:</strong><br> Fire Team is a game which is played on the Playdate Console using it's unique hardware (the crank) to pump up the water and unleash it on the ablaze building!</p>
    <p><strong>My Experience:</strong><br> Throughout my time creating Fire Team, I learned the programming language Lua! This is a small and light language which is perfect to perform tasks with minimum power, which is ideal for the Playdate!
      <br><br> I also learned how to quickly become familiar with a new SDK whilst prototyping a game. This skill will benefit me going forward with learning new programming languages and new game engines alike as I have learned how to navigate and search for the necessary functions that I may need to use!
      <br><br> Whilst creating Fire Team I had to have weekly stand ups with the game leads to show what progress I had made that week followed by prioritizing and planning the following week. To manage this project we used a kanban board on Trello!
