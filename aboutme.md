# About Me

Hi there! I am a third year studying at Manchester Metropolitan University!
Throughout my studies I have worked in many teams, including multidisciplinary teams so I can clearly communicate with team members including those that don't do the same work as myself!


# Favourite Types of games

My favourite types of games are shooters, and RPGs, this is because I both love competition and fighting to be the best but I also love to spend lots of time working through a long and well thought out story!

 As you can see from my game portfolio, I love making all types of games! From first-person shooters, to chilled out puzzle games!
