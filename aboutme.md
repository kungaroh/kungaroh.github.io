title: About Me
---

Hi there! I am a third year studying at Manchester Metropolitan University!
Throughout my studies I have worked in many teams, including multidisciplinary teams so I can clearly communicate with team members including those that don't do the same work as myself!

## Favourite Types of games

My favourite types of games are shooters, and RPGs, this is because I both love competition and fighting to be the best but I also love to spend lots of time working through a long and well thought out story!

As you can see from my game portfolio, I love making all types of games! From first-person shooters, to chilled out puzzle games!

## Game Engines Used

I have primarily used Unity throughout my studies and for any game jams I have been apart of.

# Achievements

During my second year of University, we completed a unit called Rapid Games Development, wherein all Games Development Bsc (Hons), Games Development Msc, and Games Design students would take part in 7 day long game jams where the games would be played, and awards given by the unit leaders for the best games. 

During this unit I won the following awards:
the Best Overall Game, for Mamma's Milkeria <!-- link it -->
and the Highly Commended award for Musica Gems  <!-- link it -->

I have took part and submitted a game<!-- link bacteria busters--> for the Ludum Dare 56 game jam! This is a personal achievement as it is the 72 hour/ non-degree related game jam I have submitted a game for
