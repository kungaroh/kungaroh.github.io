title: About Me
---

Hi there! I am a third year studying at Manchester Metropolitan University!
Throughout my studies I have worked in many teams, including multidisciplinary teams so I can clearly communicate with team members including those that don't do the same work as myself!

## Favourite Types of games

My favourite types of games are shooters, and RPGs, this is because I both love competition and fighting to be the best but I also love to spend lots of time working through a long and well thought out story!

As you can see from my game portfolio, I love making all types of games! From first-person shooters, to chilled out puzzle games!

# Experience

## Game Developer Playdate

Throughout this role, I collaborated with my managers to create a game idea for the Playdate Console. This involved pitching an idea, and then brainstorming game mechanic ideas to make a fun and intuitive game!
Every week I would have a meeting with my managers to demonstrate progress on the game and to discuss the features and refinements that would be completed in the following week.

# Achievements

During my second year of University, we completed a unit called Rapid Games Development, wherein all Games Development Bsc (Hons), Games Development Msc, and Games Design students would take part in 7 day long game jams where the games would be played, and awards given by the unit leaders for the best games.
